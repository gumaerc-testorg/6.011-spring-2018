Instructor Insights
-------------------

{{< quote "I think the evening Common Room is one of the best elements of the class . . . We find students working individually as well as collaboratively, and periodically interacting with the staff, either at the board or at their desk—very immersed and engaged in the homework problems, and in sorting out ideas and misconceptions related to these." "— George Verghese" >}}

_Below, Professor George Verghese describes how the teaching team facilitated_ 6.011 Signals, Systems and Inference.

Curriculum Information
----------------------

### Prerequisites

The essential prerequisites for this course are [_6.003 Signals and Systems_](/courses/6-003-signals-and-systems-fall-2011) and [_6.041A Intro to Probability I_](/courses/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013) (or equivalents), and the [_18.03 Differential Equations_](/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011) material related to solving linear, time-invariant systems of first-order differential equations using eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### Requirements Satisfied

6.011 can be applied toward a [Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/curriculum2017) and a [Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/curriculum2017).

### Offered

Student Information
-------------------

![47 students took this course when it was offered in Spring 2018.]({{< resource_file 8d6c71a1-c7a8-030b-9fc3-de37725c6223 >}})

### Breakdown by Year

Undergraduate and graduate students

### Breakdown by Major

Mostly electrical engineering and computer science

### Typical Student Background

The students in the class have increasingly varied backgrounds, varying in the extent of their general academic preparation, in their curricular concentrations, in their taste for theoretical material versus applications, and in their comfort with the prerequisite material (from a first course in signals & systems, and a first course in probability). This can make the class challenging for both the lecturer and the students, but having the lectures supplemented through recitation sections conducted by a professor, optional tutorials conducted by the teaching assistants, evening “Common Room” hours facilitated by one or two of the staff, and a textbook written specifically for this course all help to deal with the diverse student backgrounds and motivations.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, divided as follows:

In Class
--------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 24 sessions total.
*   Class sessions were lecture-based.

Recitation
----------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 24 sessions total.
*   Recitations provided an opportunity for students to clarify and work with concepts and results from lecture in a more informal and interactive setting.

Out of Class
------------

Outside of class students completed assignments and had the [opportunity to attend Common Room sessions and optional tutorials]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/instructor-insights/supporting-students-with-supplementary-opportunities).
